# Cybersecurity Internship at CodeAlpha

Welcome to my internship repository for CodeAlpha! This repository documents my journey and accomplishments during my internship at CodeAlpha. As part of the internship program, I completed three tasks, each focusing on enhancing cybersecurity skills and knowledge.

The internship program at CodeAlpha revolves around completing three tasks designed to provide hands-on experience and learning opportunities. Throughout the internship, I worked on various projects related to network security and intrusion detection.

### Task 1: Basic Network Sniffer

For my first task, I developed a basic network sniffer using Python and Scapy. This tool captures and analyzes network packets, providing insights into network traffic patterns and protocols.
